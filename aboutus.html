  <h2>Cara Ottmar</h2>
    <p>Cara hails from The Ozark Mountains (made famous by Netflix's "Ozark" and the classic "Beverly Hillbillies.") which ironically, aren't mountains at all. When not hiking actual mountains in the PNW, you can find her traveling, watching HGTV cuddled with her 3 and 4 legged dogs, playing board games, or a mean game of team trivia.</p>

  <h2>Ryan Groesch</h2>
    <p>I am a left-handed, motorcycle riding, sportsball loving nerd. My interests branch to anything from athletics (baseball, frisbee, football, curling and even cricket) to intellectual endeavors (videogames, reading and thoughtful discussions). I look to learn something everyday and take that one step closer to being a "renaissance man".</p>
