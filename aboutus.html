      <h2>Cara Ottmar</h2>
      <p>Cara hails from The Ozark Mountains (made famous by Netflix's "Ozark" and the classic "Beverly Hillbillies"), which ironically, aren't mountains at all. When not hiking actual mountains in the PNW, you can find her traveling, watching HGTV cuddled with her 3 and 4 legged dogs, playing board games, or a mean game of team trivia.</p>
